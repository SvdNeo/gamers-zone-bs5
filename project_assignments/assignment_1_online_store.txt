Assignment Title: Online Store with Local Storage Authentication and Order Management using Bootstrap 5

Objective:
Build a simple online store application that allows users to sign up, log in, view and 
purchase items from a local array of product objects, manage their favorite items, and create tickets for order issues.

Technologies:
* HTML
* CSS (Bootstrap 5)
* JavaScript (jQuery)
* Local Storage
* JSON

Assignment Tasks:

* User Authentication:
    * Create a sign-up page with fields for username and password.
    * Implement user registration and store user information (username and password) in local storage.
    * Create a login page with fields for username and password.
    * Implement login functionality, validate credentials against stored user data in local storage, and allow users to access the main application upon successful login.

* Displaying Items:
    * Create a local array of product objects containing a list of items available for purchase in your online store.
    * Design and implement a page that displays all the items from the local array of product objects using Bootstrap 5 cards.
    * Each card should include details such as name, description, price, image_url and an "Add to Cart" button.

* Adding Favorites:
    * Allow logged-in users to mark items as favorites.
    * Implement a feature that lets users view their list of favorite items.
    * Store the list of favorite items in local storage, associating the data with the logged-in user.

* Orders Management:
    * Create a tab-based interface to manage orders: "Pending Orders," "Completed Orders," and "Cancelled Orders."
    * Implement functionality to move orders between tabs based on their status.
    * For simplicity, you can use a simple "Order" object with properties like order ID, date, items purchased, and status (pending, completed, cancelled).

* Create Ticket for Order Issue:
    * In the "Pending Orders" tab, provide an option to create a ticket for any order with an issue.
    * Implement a form where users can describe the issue with their order.
    * Upon submission, store the ticket information (order ID, description, date, etc.) in local storage, associating it with the logged-in user.

Bonus Tasks (Optional):
* Add a shopping cart feature where users can add items from the store before checking out.
* Implement a search functionality to allow users to search for specific items.
* Improve the design and user interface of the application using additional Bootstrap components.
